# Olympic Data Analysis Web Application

## Project Overview

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to interactively analyze historical Olympic data through a set of well-structured visual modules and also includes a machine learning-based medal prediction feature. The application showcases real-time filtering, analytical insights, predictive modeling, and clear visualizations, making it useful for academic research, presentations, and general data exploration.

## Objectives

- To transform raw Olympic data into meaningful visual insights.
- To build a modular and interactive analytical dashboard using Streamlit.
- To support dynamic data filtering and rendering for customized user views.
- To integrate a predictive model for forecasting potential Olympic medal wins.
- To provide a smooth, intuitive user experience without requiring programming knowledge.

## Features

- Medal tally analysis by country and year.
- Overall Olympic statistics including events, athletes, and nations.
- Country-wise performance trends over the years.
- Athlete-wise analysis including most successful players and participation metrics.
- Gender participation visualizations.
- Machine Learning-based Medal Prediction Module using Random Forest Classifier.
- User-friendly interface with responsive filters and dynamic charts.
